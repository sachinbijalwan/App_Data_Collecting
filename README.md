BASIC DESCRIPTION -:

* This repository is an android studio project for making an app that can record a video and along with video, it is also recording accelerometer sensor values and gps location of the mobile phone used in the context.

* This repository is being developed by Sachin Bijalwan. Future developers can add their name in this point.

********************************************************************************************************************************

BASIC WORKING -:

* Using Camera2 classes to record videos. I have basically copied my whole code of video fragment and xml file from the github repository "https://github.com/googlesamples/android-Camera2Basic".

* Using sensors classes for GPS and accelerometer. (Sources enclosed in the end of this file).

* Using Cursor Adapter to display list of videos recorded.

* Using Tab view to display datas related to app.

**********************************************************************************************************************************

IMPROVMENTS LEFT IN APP -:

* Recording the data to the maximum precision but displaying data to a fixed point of precision.

* A way of converting database tables to a Microsoft excel sheet.

* Removing the info button copied from the github repository and some trash files along with it.

* Find a better way for recording data because the smartphone is becoming too much heat as a result of overprocessing of data.

* Removing below mentioned bugs.

***********************************************************************************************************************************

BUGS -:

* On opening the tablayout , the first gps tab is not loaded in the first time.

* Some other bug is responsible for the crash of the app.
